IEEE QCE 2022</A>
</H2>
IEEE's flagship quantum computing conference just concluded at Denver, Colorado (https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2022/). It was attended by researchers, academics, industrialists, VCs, policy makers and also government representatives with interest in the coming quantum revolution. I had three takeaways from this conference:
1) The eco-system is growing exponentially across the value chain without waiting for fault-tolerant error correction
2) A stronger focus is required on reliability and reproducibility of claims on "breakthroughs"
3) Investors might have a need for good translators who can strike the balance between hype and rational optimism and explain their reasoning with clarity and conviction

p.s. I also had the opportunity to present a couple of papers/ talks at this conference (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9259941)
