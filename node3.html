2022 Nobel Prize</A>
</H2>
It's exciting when the stalwarts in your field receive Nobel prize. Beyond the egotistical satisfaction, it has a multiplicative impact on public education, government support, industry interest as well as drawing the best of future talent into the field. Three stalwarts of Quantum Information Science received the Nobel prize yesterday (not to be confused with "quantum physics" -  a field which no longer thinks deeply about the fundamental issues). Their work shed light on the second of the two differentiators of quantum from classical: entanglement (the first is superposition). What is it?

<P>
Suppose you have three coins (the three Paulis for the "experts"). You toss them multiple times and observe in how many cases the first and second coins are the same. Call that observation N12. Divide it by the total number of times you did the experiment (say M) and call the result p12. Thus, p12 is the "probability" that first two coins are same. Now do the same to get p23 and p13. Bell's inequality (a very trivial classical inequality) says p12 + p23 + p13 is larger than 1. This is classically a trivial result because any two coins out of three coins is bound to be identical. Quantumly, this inequality is violated (in a specific experimental setting). That is p12 + p23 + p12 is smaller than 1.

<P>
This should make no "sense". If it does, we probably did not understand (as Bohrs famously said). John Bell died before he could be awarded the Nobel prize for his insights from the Bell's inequality. The recipients yesterday significantly extended his work (such as by framing the CHSH inequality).

<P>
Thanks,

p.s. The specific experimental setting is as follows: you need to prepare two sets of "entangled" coins and ship one set to New York and do the measurements described above in Kolkata. The New York coins impact the Kolkata coins in a mysterious way we do not "understand" (as the word "understanding" is based on classical facts stored in our brain). It is what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance" and went to grave unreconciled with. It has been decisively "proven" to be true in 2015 in a no loophole experiment (barring extreme loopholes like everything is a simulation).
