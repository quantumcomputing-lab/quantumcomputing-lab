Quantum Advantage</A>
</H2>
What is quantum advantage? It refers to the milestone when a quantum computer can do what is not possible with a classical machine. Google's quantum computer is called Sycamore. One of Google's scientists has published a paper (in Science) that uses quantum computing to analyze "big-data" from quantum sensors using quantum machine learning.

<P>
(Quantum sensors btw are used for high-precision measurements (e.g. in quantum metrology). They use correlations between particles to extract more information about a system than would be available otherwise.) Well, it is not surprising to me that a classical agent can't access and learn from quantum information. But it seems like the quantum learning agent performed exponentially better than classical agent even in tasks not involving quantum data.

<P>
In fact, quantum NNs running on quantum devices can already be trained faster than classical NNs (the latter takes weeks). These may have further applications in financial services e.g. fraud detection. We will see!
