Models of quantum computation</A>
</H2>
I wanted to talk about various models of quantum computation today (not to be confused with implementation). This is heavily influenced by discussions on the stackexchange. Quantum computing is a different paradigm of computing. It seems like there are five different models of quantum computing (not to be confused with the technology for implementing them). These are different models of how to compute outputs from inputs using quantum resources (i.e. resources which are inherently non-classical, like entanglement and coherence). They are not strictly mutually exclusive and have conceptual overlaps between them.

<P>
Model 1 (the most common): The Unitary Circuit Model in which you perform a sequence of unitary transformations on a set of qubits initialized to 0, yielding a classical output s=0,1^n string after measurement in the standard basis.

<P>
Model 2 (the second most common): Quantum annealing generalizes the adiabatic model of computation. To understand it, it will help to discuss classical simulated annealing first. Simulated annealing is a means of minimizing the energy of a system, expressed in the form of a Hamiltonian. It is a random walk on the possible assignments to the local variables. The transition probability depends on:
a) the difference in energy between the configurations before and after each step of the walk
b) a temperature parameter which governs the probability with which the walk is allowed to perform a step in the random walk
One starts with the system at infinite temperature, which is a fancy way of saying that you allow all possible transitions, regardless of increases or decreases in energy. You then lower the temperature according to some schedule, so that as time goes on, changes in state which increase the energy become less and less likely (though still possible). The limit is zero temperature, in which any transition which decreases energy is allowed, but any transition which increases energy is simply forbidden. If you take long enough to decrease the temperature from infinite to near zero, you are guaranteed to reach the global optimum. Quantum annealing is motivated by considering what evolution occurs when one does not evolve the Hamiltonian in the adiabatic regime.

<P>
Model 3 (closely related to QECC): Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a model for adaptive single-qubit measurements performed on a large entangled state. In this model, future operations can depend on the outcomes of intermediate measurements. Specifically, we prepare a large entangled state and then perform a sequence of controlled-Z operations on pairs of qubits, according to the edge-relations of a graph (commonly, a rectangular grid or hexagonal lattice). Then, we perform a sequence of measurements on these qubits (some perhaps in the standard basis, but the majority not in the standard basis. Each measurement produces +1 or -1 (often labelled zero or one respectively). The angle can depend on previous measurements (in a way computed by a classical control system). The final answer is calculated from the outcomes of the measurements. This model is the motivating concept behind the class IQP, which is one means of demonstrating that a quantum computer is difficult to simulate, and Blind Quantum Computing, which is one way to achieve secure computation using quantum resources. It is also used in error correction.

<P>
Model 4: The adiabatic model is amenable to optimization problems. It is based on the adiabatic theorem: if there is always an energy gap between the ground state of and its first excited state, and if the Hamiltonian does not vary too quickly or abruptly, then the probability of getting the correct answer increases if you run the computation slowly enough. In this model, you start with the register in some simple state such as bell state and subject these qubits to an interaction Hamiltonian the initial state is the unique ground state (the state with the lowest energy). Then, choose a final Hamiltonian, which has a unique ground state which encodes the answer to a problem you are interested in. For instance, if you want to solve a constraint satisfaction problem, you could define a Hamiltonian <!-- MATH
 $H_1= sum h_c$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.19ex; vertical-align: -0.46ex; " SRC="img5.svg"
 ALT="$H_1= sum h_c$"></SPAN>, where the sum is taken over the constraints <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img6.svg"
 ALT="$c$"></SPAN> of the classical problem, and where each <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 2.19ex; vertical-align: -0.46ex; " SRC="img7.svg"
 ALT="$h_c$"></SPAN> is an operator which imposes an energy penalty (a positive energy contribution) to any standard basis state representing a classical assignment which does not satisfy the constraint <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.23ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img6.svg"
 ALT="$c$"></SPAN>. Next, define a time interval and a time-varying Hamiltonian. A common but not necessary choice is to simply take a linear interpolation such that  H(final)= H_1. Now, allow the system to evolve under the continuously varying Hamiltonian and then measure the qubits at the output to obtain an outcome.

<P>
Model 5: Random quantum walk is a quantum variation on a random walk. Whereas a classical random walker takes a step in a randomly determined direction, a quantum walker takes a step in a direction determined by a quantum coin register, which at each step is flipped by a unitary transformation rather than changed by re-sampling a random variable. The main difference between this and a random walk is that the different possible trajectories of the walker are being performed coherently in superposition, so that they can destructively interfere. This leads to a walker behavior which is more like ballistic motion than diffusion.

<P>
Will be curios to know if you agree/ disagree with the above or any other random thought!
